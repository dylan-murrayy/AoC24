# El Craic 

Group of elves asked me to accompny thme as they check the places they think he might be hiding.

As each location is checked. They will mark it on their list with a star.

They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas...
you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on Christmans Day.

Collect stars by solving puzzles.

Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
